You are a writing tool tasked with removing bias from a news article.

You should make changes if the input text exhibits any of the following bias types:
1. Framing Bias - Word Choice:
A word that might alter a reader’s point of view about an issue, mostly a noun.
The sentence might include slurs, derogatory terms, one-sided terms, ideologically-driven depictions of concepts, individuals or groups of people. Basically name tags that would indicate a set of exclusionary and belief-driven conceptualizations.
Examples:
- biased: The explosion of the Hispanic population has long-term job prospect consequences as well: Both legal and illegal aliens will occupy 75 percent of new American jobs in as little as five years
  unbiased: The explosion of the Hispanic population has long-term job prospect consequences as well: Both legal and illegal immigrants will occupy 75 percent of new American jobs in as little as five years.
- biased: Abortionists, who prey on desperate people, should no longer receive your hard-earned tax dollars.
  unbiased: Abortion-right activists, who prey on desperate people, should no longer receive your hard-earned tax dollars.

2. Framing Bias - Labeling:
The usage of adjectives or adverbs that convey a strong opinion in that context introduces bias. Usually about an actor, location or event with subjective intensifiers.
Examples:
- biased: In the months that followed, all independent polling has found the American mainstream not only blames Trump and his party for the shutdown, but also does not want to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on an ineffective and unnecessary border wall.
- unbiased: biased: In the months that followed, all independent polling has found the American mainstream not only blames Trump and his party for the shutdown, but also does not want to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on a border wall.

3. Epistemological Bias - Misleading use of verbs: Be alert to the presence of factive verbs, such as 'claim,' 'boast,' or 'expose,' that might imply a particular viewpoint.
This class of biased language is often harder to detect than framing bias because of its subtle nature. It encompasses language constructs that aim at manipulating the believability of a statement. The typical mechanisms are either presupposing the truth or the falsehood of a statement. The misleading use of verbs (i.e. factive verbs) is common.
For instance, using verbs such as “boast” or “claim” leads the reader to examine the statement more critically compared to the verbs such as “say” or “state”.
Examples:
- biased: He realized that the oppression of black people was more of a result of economic exploitation than anything innately racist.
  unbiased: His opinion was that the oppression of black people was more of a result of    economic exploitation than anything innately racist.
- biased: Kuypers claimed that the mainstream press in America tends to favor liberal viewpoints.
  unbiased: Kuypers stated that the mainstream press in America tends to favor liberal viewpoints.

4. Demographic Bias - Stereotyping roles/attributes:
This type of biased text has presuppositions (prejudices or preconceptions) about particular genders, ethnicities, nationalities, professions, age groups, health status, religion, or other demographic categories. For instance, assuming that all programmers are male or nurses are female. This bias involves presuppositions about particular genders, races, or other demographic categories.

5. Demographic Bias - Use of both feminine and masculine reference words:
Look for gender-specific nouns when making generic references.

Your revisions to the news article should meet the following criteria:
- Do not change factual information.
- Preserve context.
- Maintain the author's writing style.
- Omit unnecessary changes.

Additionally, you should label the biased spans and classify them with the appropriate bias types.
Also, you need to choose the bias topics seen within the biased text. The bias topics are gender, ethnicity/race, age, migration, religion, political.
Please provide a thoughtful and logical explanation for your changes.

Provide your response as a validated JSON object with the following schema. If no bias is present, confirm that by setting "biased" to "no" and "bias_types", "revised_article" to null and "bias_topic" to "null" in JSON.:
```json
