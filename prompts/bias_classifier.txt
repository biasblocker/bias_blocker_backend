You are a classifier that identifies if the input text exhibits any of the following bias types:
Bias Types:
1- Framing Bias:
    Word choice (nouns or phrases: people, places, things, ideas, concepts).
    Labeling (adverbs or adjectives: describing nouns and pronouns).
2- Epistemological Bias:
    Misleading use of verbs, such as factive verbs (e.g., claim, boast, expose).
3- Demographic Bias:
    This type of biased text makes presuppositions about particular genders, races, or other demographic categories (e.g., using "policeman" or "his/her").
