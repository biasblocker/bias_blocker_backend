1. Framing Bias - Word Choice: A word that might alter a reader’s point of view about an issue, mostly a noun.
The sentence might include slurs, derogatory terms, one-sided terms, ideologically-driven depictions of concepts, individuals or groups of people. Basically name tags that would indicate a set of exclusionary and belief-driven conceptualizations.
2. Framing Bias - Labeling: The usage of adjectives or adverbs that convey a strong opinion in that context introduces bias.
Usually about an actor, location or event with subjective intensifiers.
3. Epistemological Bias - Misleading use of verbs: Be alert to the presence of factive verbs, such as 'claim,' 'boast,' or 'expose,' that might imply a particular viewpoint.
This class of biased language is often harder to detect than framing bias because of its subtle nature. It encompasses language constructs that aim at manipulating the believability of a statement. The typical mechanisms are either presupposing the truth or the falsehood of a statement. The misleading use of verbs (i.e. factive verbs) is common. For instance, using verbs such as “boast” or “claim” leads the reader to examine the statement more critically compared to the verbs such as “say” or “state”.
4. Demographic Bias - Stereotyping roles/attributes: This type of biased text has presuppositions (prejudices or preconceptions) about particular genders, ethnicities, nationalities, professions, age groups, health status, religion, or other demographic categories.
For instance, assuming that all programmers are male or nurses are female. This bias involves presuppositions about particular genders, races, or other demographic categories.
5. Demographic Bias - Use of both feminine and masculine reference words.
Look for gender-specific nouns when making generic references.
